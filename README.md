Positive_Maturity
=================

Positive Maturity is a senior assistance agency based out of Birmingham, Alabama. The goal of the project was to create a desktop application that employees could use that would give them quick access to information about agenies in the Alabama area. The agency's information was given to me in the form of a excel spreadsheet list which I converted into a mysql database located on the Positive Maturity server. On the application side, it is programmed in java using swing elements to give it the desktop look. The applicaiton connects to the database using the jdbc Drivers. It give Positive Maturity's employees the ability to search agencies, view detailed information, update information, and create new agency entries in the database all within a nice desktop app. I received high remarks from the Executive Director of Positive Maturity along with letters of recommendation. This was my first taste of a non academic project and I enjoyed working on it
